# DreamCatchr

This is "DreamCatchr" a web app which allows users to track their dreams and explore potential interpretations, read dreams of other users and follow users. It was built with React, Ruby on Rails, Nokogiri, the Artsy API.

The dream interpretations were scraped from https://cafeausoul.com, modified slightly, and paired with surreal imagery queried from the Artsy API. The DreamCatchr dream tags JSON can be found at https://majestic-canyonlands-27127.herokuapp.com/dream_tags. The live frontend is available at https://dreamcatchr.herokuapp.com/.

Enjoy!
